In this post I'll be talking about my internship that I just completed this past summer.
I had the priviledge to be the only mechanical engineering intern at Kohler Ronan LLC. There I worked with professional project engineers and mechanical engineers maily, while also interacting with some electrical engineers and plumbers.
Overall, it ws a very rewarding experience and I feel as if I learned many new skills.
